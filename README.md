## 🔍 Step 1: Data Cleaning and Preparation  

✅ Before anything else, I prepared the data to make the analysis smoother.  
I used Python along with the `pandas` and `numpy` libraries for this task.  

📌 Here’s a summary of what I did:  

- **Removed unnecessary columns:**  
  I dropped irrelevant columns like `CustomerId` and `Surname`.  

- **Eliminated duplicate records:**  
  Used `drop_duplicates` to remove redundant data.  

- **Handled missing values:**  
  Removed null values using `dropna`.  

- **Renamed columns:**  
  Changed column names to simpler English names for better readability.  

- **Converted numerical values to boolean:**  
  Transformed fields like `Credit Card`, `Active Member`, and `Exited` into `True/False`.  

🔻 After these steps, I had a clean and structured dataset ready for Power BI.
